\section*{Introduction}
% Rationale for creating the dataset(s) and/or objectives for the experiment
% resulting in the dataset - why the data were gathered or produced.

Cognitive neuroimaging research is moving towards studying brain behavior under
conditions of real-life-like complexity, and, frequently, movies are utilized
as stimuli in these ``neurocinematics'' studies
\citep{hasson_2008_neurocinematics}. What sets movies apart from other dynamic
naturalistic stimuli is that they are more likely to evoke time-locked response
patterns in a larger portion of the brain that are synchronous across multiple
individuals who are experiencing the same movie
\citep{hasson_2009_natural_stim_review,lankinen_2014_MEG_during_movie}. One
reason for this is likely the structure of movies. They are typically not a
prolonged contiguous capture of the environment in a first person view, but are
carefully assembled from hundreds of short sequences from various perspectives
that are practically always joined by cuts
\citep{cutting_2011_changing_poetics_of_dissolve}. These cuts are sharp
discontinuities in the sensory input that require all viewers to re-assess the
depicted environment in order to perform a cognitive
re-orientation in fictional space and time. This re-orientation can be complex
and involve a large bandwidth of cognitive processes: detection of familiar
settings, retrieval of prior knowledge from memory, discovery of change in
locales and depicted characters. Consequently, movies, and, in particular, their
cuts offer an instrument to study complex, concurrent, real-life cognition.

In this study, we focus on spatial and temporal viewer re-orientation, and, to
this end, describe change in depicted location and time for all cuts in the
motion picture ``Forrest Gump''. This movie is the core stimulus of the
\textit{studyforrest} project (\url{http://studyforrest}). Two fMRI datasets
are publicly available: 1) participants listening to an audio-movie version
\citep{HBI+14}, and 2) a subset of the original participants watching the
audio-visual movie with simultaneous eye tracking \citep{HAK+16}. Additional
imaging data and movie annotations are available \citep{HDH+2015,LRS+2015},
notably an individual localization of the \textit{parahippocampal place area}
\citep{SKG+16} that has been implicated in spatial perception and scene
processing \citep{EK1998}.

This new annotation extends the available knowledge about the structure of this
complex natural stimulus, and enriches the joint studyforrest dataset. These
data can be used to investigate the formation of a representation of viewer
location, and the perception of (speeded or negative) temporal progression in
the movie stimulus. For any study focusing on other aspects of real-life
cognition these new data can serve as additional confound measures describing
key properties of main building blocks of this movie stimulus.

\subsection*{Stimulus}

The annotated stimulus was a slightly shortened ($\approx$\unit[2]{h}) version
of the movie Forrest~Gump (R.~Zemeckis, Paramount Pictures, 1994) with dubbed
German soundtrack, and is identical to the audio-visual movie annotated in
\cite{LRS+2015}. Further details on this particular movie cut, and how to
reproduce it from commercially available sources are available in
\cite{HAK+16}.

additional anno, e.g. +, int, day)}

The shortened movie was annotated manually using the free, open source,
cross-platform video editor Shotcut (version 16.02.01). It offers
the possibility to watch a movie frame by frame and read a frame's timing
with the precision of the movie frame rate. A separate spreadsheet
software (LibreOffice Calc, version 5.1.4.2) was used to write the
actual annotation into a text file with comma-separated values (structure.csv). 

\subsection*{Annotation content}

The annotation file comprises seven columns: One column for 1) the
shot's start time, 2) the shot's major location, 3) it's setting,
4) it's locale, 5) an interior exterior distinction of the location,
6) it's temporal progression in respect to the previous shot and 7) it's
time of day. 

\subsubsection*{Shot start time}

A shot's start time is defined as the first frame of a shot after
a cut. The timings are written in the format hour:minute:second:frame.
The values for the frame range from 0 to 24, reflecting the movie's
frame rate of 25 frames per second. 

% 870 shots if last "shot" which only contains black frames counts as a shot
To check for human errors and validate the timings, the manual annotation was
compared to an annotation created by an in-house developed, automated cut
detection algorithm. In summary the shortened version of the movie comprises \NShots\ shots (duration:
min=\unit[\ShotLengthMin]{s}, max=\unit[\ShotLengthMax]{s},
median=\unit[\ShotLengthMedian]{s}, SD=\unit[\ShotLengthSD]{s}).


\subsubsection*{Location}

The location shown at the beginning of every shot was written into
three different columns, reflecting increasing granularity: From the
major location via setting through to locale. The movie's screenplay
by Robert Roth (first draft; December 18, 1992) served as a template
for the naming of the filmed locations. Where reasonable namings were
adjusted. Further spatial information was added to fit into the three
columns.

Firstly, the major location represents the location on a more abstract
level. It represents the city resp. town or, if the exact city is
unknown, the region or country. For example Greenbow, Washington D.C.
or Vietnam. 

Secondly, the setting represents a subcategory for places which are
in the same major location, but are not in direct sight. For example
Forrest Gump's elementary school and the football field, which are
both in the same major location of Greenbow, Alabama. A switch from
one setting into another setting is mostly, but not always, congruent
with a switch into another scene in a cinematographic sense.

Lastly, a setting was further subdivided into distinguishable locales.
Indoors, a locale is congruent with a particular room bounded by its
walls or floor. For example Forrest Gump's bedroom, the corridor downstairs
and the corridor upstairs are three different rooms inside the Gumps'
house (setting) on the Gumps' property (major location). Outdoors,
different locales were assumed if two places could be considered as
different rooms due to their distance to each other, due to logical
borders or due to no or only a small number of overlapping objects
and geometrical features. For example the glade at the river and the 
finding place of Bubba are two different locales in the embattled jungle 
(setting) in Vietnam (major location). A locale is equal to it's
setting, when a setting depicts only one locale. 


\subsubsection*{Interior or exterior setting}

Regarding the interior exterior distinction, a location inside a building
or inside a car was labeled with ``int'', while locations outdoors
were labeled with ``ext''. 


\subsubsection*{Temporal progression}

Firstly, every flashback, no matter how short the skipped time is, was
coded as >>-<<. Second, a >>0<< was chosen, when the cut is supposed
to show no noticeable break in the ongoing stream of time. In other
words, in those cases the action is supposed to be edited in a continuous
fashion, so the action is only shown from a different viewpoint after
the cut. Third, a ``+'' represents noticeable breaks in the ongoing
stream of time, ranging from mostly several seconds to about one to
two hours. Finally, a ``++'' is used for obvious, major time jumps,
ranging from mostly several hours (e.g. day to night) to a couple
of years.


\subsubsection*{Time of day }

The last column represents the time of day as a binary variable. If
the sun light is at least partially illuminating the scene, the time
of day is coded as ``day''. By this rationale twilights (early sunrises
and late sun settings) are also subsumed as ``day''. If sun light
is entirely missing, the time of day is coded as ``night''.

\todo[inline]{What exactly is released, in what format?}

\paragraph{Source code}

The full source code for all descriptive statistics and figures included in
this paper is available in \texttt{descriptive\_stats.py} (Python script).


\section*{Dataset validation}
% Information about any validation carried out and/or any limitations of the
% datasets, including any allowances made for controlling bias or unwanted
% sources of variability.
Locations only name places shown at the beginning of the shot, meaning 
movements of the camera position during the shot are not taken into account.
2-3 dissolves are counted as cuts
Subdividing settings into locales outside is kinda subjective 

\todo[inline]{Place any information and illustrative figures here that help
people figure out whether these annotation are useful/trustworthy for them}

\subsection*{from raw annotation to experimental conditions}

\todo[inline]{this section could be stripped of all FSL/MRI references
  and converted into a ``validation'' that lists possible conditions
  and counts the respective events in each, so people get a sense of
  what is there. I would also remove the ``no-cut'' references, as those
  are relatively arbitrary decision that are only meaningful in a particular
context, not for the general annotation data}

The first script (01\_structure\_annot\_to\_all\_timings.py) took
the annotation as input and created a new csv-file (structure\_5\_conditions\_10sec.csv)
with columns ``time\_stamp'', ``seconds'' and ``condition''.
The time stamp was a copy of the time stamp given in the raw annotation.
It served for later visual inspection of conditions' correctness by
easily copy and pasting it into Shotcut. 

The column ``seconds'' coded the timing of an event's beginning
from the movie's start in the format seconds.milliseconds. The column
``condition'' coded an event's respective condition. The 5 conditions
are named as follows: 1) ``setting\_new'', 2) ``setting\_old'',
3) ``locale\_change'', 4) ``perspective\_new'' and 5) ``perspective\_old''. 

The rules to produce the condition from the annotation were as follows:
When the setting or the major location was different from the setting
in the previous line, the script assumed a switch of the setting.
When the movie depicted the setting for the first time, the setting
was regarded as unfamiliar (``setting\_new'') otherwise as familiar
(``setting\_old''). When only the locale was different to the previous
line, the script assumed a switch into another room (condition ``locale\_change'').
When alle three locations (major location, setting and locale) in
the current line were equal to the previous line, the script assumed
a simple switch of the perspective inside the same locale. When a
locale was depicted for the first time, the perspective was considered
as unfamiliar (``perspectiv\_new'') otherwise as familiar (``perspective\_new''). 

The total number of events for the conditions were: 96 events for
setting\_new (Mdn = 8.92; SD = 21.882 s), 90 events for setting\_old
(Mdn = 7.68; SD = 9.440 s), 89 events for locale\_change (Mdn = 6.96;
SD = 8855 s), 386 events for perspective\_new (occuring in shots with
median shot length of 3.96 s; SD = 7.484 s), and 208 events for perspective\_old
(Mdn = 3.5 s; SD = 7.470 s)\todo{stats in this paragraph need to be computed from
annotation}
