% Abstracts should be up to 300 words and provide a succinct summary of the
% article. Although the abstract should explain why the article might be
% interesting, care should be taken not to inappropriately over-emphasise the
% importance of the work described in the article. Citations should not be used
% in the abstract, and the use of abbreviations should be minimized.
Here we present a complementary annotation of the audio-visual movie “Forrest
Gump” as part of a large public functional brain imaging dataset
(studyforrest; http://studyforrest.org). The annotation provides information
about the exact timing of every cut and the depicted location after every
cut with a high, a medium and<w a low level of abstraction as well as a
distinction between interior and exterior. It additionally provides
information about the type of temporal progression from one shot to the
next and about the time of day the shot’s action is taking place.
Further, we present descriptive statistics of the annotated variables.
Statistics suggest the movie can be used to study visual perception or memory
of locations and the perception of time.

\section*{Introduction}
% ~380 words
% Rationale for creating the dataset(s) and/or objectives for the experiment
% resulting in the dataset - why the data were gathered or produced.

Cognitive neuroimaging research is moving towards studying brain behavior under
conditions of real-life-like complexity, and, frequently, motion pictures are
utilized as stimuli in ``neurocinematics'' studies
\citep{hasson_2008_neurocinematics}. What sets motion pictures apart from other
dynamic naturalistic stimuli is that they are more likely to evoke time-locked
response patterns in a larger portion of the brain that are synchronous across
multiple individuals who are experiencing the same movie
\citep{hasson_2009_natural_stim_review,lankinen_2014_MEG_during_movie}. One
reason for this is likely the structure of movies. They are typically not a
prolonged contiguous capture of the environment in a first person view, but are
carefully assembled from hundreds of short sequences from various perspectives
that are practically always joined by cuts
\citep{cutting_2011_changing_poetics_of_dissolve}. These cuts are sharp
discontinuities in the sensory input that require all viewers to re-assess the
depicted environment in order to perform a cognitive re-orientation in
fictional space and time. This re-orientation can be complex and involve a
large bandwidth of cognitive processes: detection of familiar settings,
retrieval of prior knowledge from memory, discovery of change in locales and
depicted characters. Consequently, movies, and, in particular, their cuts offer
an instrument to study complex, concurrent, real-life cognition.

In this study, we focus on spatial and temporal viewer re-orientation, and, to
this end, describe change in depicted location and time for all cuts in the
motion picture ``Forrest Gump''. This movie is the core stimulus of the
\textit{studyforrest} project (\url{http://studyforrest}). Two fMRI datasets
are publicly available: 1) participants listening to an audio-movie version
\citep{HBI+14}, and 2) a subset of the original participants watching the
audio-visual movie with simultaneous eye tracking \citep{HAK+16}. Additional
imaging data and movie annotations are available \citep{HDH+2015,LRS+2015},
including an individual localization of the \textit{parahippocampal place area}
\citep{SKG+16} that has been implicated in spatial perception and scene
processing \citep{EK1998}.

This new annotation extends the available knowledge about the structure of this
complex natural stimulus, and enriches the joint studyforrest dataset. These
data can be used to investigate the formation of a representation of viewer
location, and the perception of (speeded or negative) temporal progression in
the movie stimulus. For any study focusing on other aspects of real-life
cognition these new data can serve as additional confound measures describing
key properties of major building blocks of this movie stimulus.


\section*{Materials and methods}
% Detailed account of the protocol used to generate the dataset

\subsection*{Stimulus}

% ~600 words
The annotated stimulus was a slightly shortened ($\approx$\unit[2]{h}) version
of the movie Forrest~Gump (R.~Zemeckis, Paramount Pictures, 1994) with dubbed
German soundtrack, and is identical to the audio-visual movie annotated in
\cite{LRS+2015}. Further details on this particular movie cut, and how to
reproduce it from commercially available sources are available in
\cite{HAK+16}.


\subsection*{Annotation procedure}

First the movie was explored by two persons, one of them with an academic
background in documentary filmmaking, in order to generate a consistent list of
labels for depicted and recurring locations.

Subsequently, the actual annotation was performed by the first author using a
multi-pass strategy. The movie was manually investigated frame-by-frame to
determine the location of cuts (using the video editor Shotcut v16.02.01). Cut
timing was later validated against the results of an automated detection
routine. For each new shot (sequence between two cuts) a number of properties,
described below, were determined and entered into a table. A total of four
passes were performed in order to validate the annotation.


\subsection*{Data legend}

The annotation table contains one line per shot and
seven columns: 1) a shot's \textit{start time}, 2) a label for the shot's
\textit{major location}, 3) a label for the \textit{setting} within the
location, 4) a label for the \textit{locale} within the setting, 5) a flag
indicating an \textit{interior or exterior} setting, 6) a label for the type of
\textit{temporal progression} with respect to the previous shot, and 7) a label
for the \textit{time of day}. Further details are provided in the following
sections.

\begin{table}
\caption{Example lines from the annotation early in the movie}
\label{tab:example}
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
\hline\\ 
\textbf{time} & \textbf{major location} & \textbf{setting} & \textbf{locale} & \textbf{int or ext} & \textbf{flow of time} & \textbf{time of day}\\
\\\hline\\

00:05:43:01 & Greenbow Alabama  & main street  & in front of barbershop  & ext  & ++ & day\tabularnewline
\\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\subsubsection*{Shot start time}

A shot's start time is defined as the onset time of the first video frame of a
shot after a cut. Time stamps a provided in seconds of movie onset. 

\subsubsection*{Location}

Location was coded with three labels, describing the depicted scenary
in increasing level of detail.

\paragraph{Major location} provides a course identification at the level of a
town, county, or region where the respective story is taking place. Examples are:
``Greenbow'', or ``Vietnam''.

\paragraph{Setting} further details location by distinguishing places at the same
major location, which are not in direct sight of each other. For example
Forrest Gump's elementary school and the football field, both in Greenbow,
Alabama. A switch from one setting to another is typically synonymous with a
transition to a new scene in a cinematographic sense. If the camera switched 
settings within a scene, the annotation deviates from the screenplay to make that
switch to another setting explicit.

\paragraph{Locale} subdivides settings into distinguishable locales.  Indoors, a
locale is congruent with a particular room enclosed by walls. For example
Forrest Gump's bedroom, the corridor downstairs and the corridor upstairs are
three different rooms inside the Gumps' house (setting) on the Gumps' property
(major location). Outdoors, locales were distinguished when they were separated
by a logical boundary, substantial distance, or shared no landmarks.  For
example the glade at the river and the location of the wounded Bubba are two
different locales in the embattled jungle (setting) in Vietnam (major
location). A locale's label is identical to the respective setting label, when
only one locale is depicted for this setting.


\subsubsection*{Interior or exterior}

This flag indicates whether a particular location is an open
(``\texttt{ext}''), or enclosed space (``\texttt{int}''), such as a building,
or a vehicle.


\subsubsection*{Temporal progression}

This label indicates the depicted progression of time between the previous and
the current shot. Four categories were distinguished: ``\texttt{-}'' labels a
flashback, or jump into the past, independent of the temporal distance;
``\texttt{0}'' indicates no noticeable break in the ongoing stream of time, for
example a sole change of viewing perspective; ``\texttt{+}'' represents
noticeable jumps in time, ranging from several seconds to about one or two
hours; and lastly ``\texttt{++}'' marks major time jumps from several hours
(e.g.  night vs. day) to several years.


\subsubsection*{Time of day}

This flag indicates whether a scene is at least partially illuminated by sun
light. Consequently, day time and twilight (early sunrises and late sun
settings) are labeled ``\texttt{day}''. If sun light is entirely missing,
the time of day is coded as ``\texttt{night}''.



\subsection*{Dataset content}

\todo[inline]{What exactly is released, in what format?}

\paragraph{Source code}

The full source code for all descriptive statistics and figures included in
this paper is available in \texttt{descriptive\_stats.py} (Python script).


\section*{Dataset validation}
% Information about any validation carried out and/or any limitations of the
% datasets, including any allowances made for controlling bias or unwanted
% sources of variability.

To check for human error in the cut time annotation, timings were compared to
the results of an automatic detection algorithm and any deviation was manually
verified.

In summary, the shortened version of the movie comprises \NShots\ shots
(duration: min=\unit[\ShotLengthMin]{s}, max=\unit[\ShotLengthMax]{s},
median=\unit[\ShotLengthMedian]{s}, SD=\unit[\ShotLengthSD]{s}). There are
\NExteriorShots\ shots depicting outdoor locations and \NInteriorShots\
interior shots. Most shots take place during day time (\NDayShots\ day
vs.~\NNightShots\ night). The majority of a shot transitions portray no
noticable discontinuities of depicted time (\NShotsTimeNoJump), but the are
\NShotsTimeSmallJump\ small, and \NShotsTimeLargeJump\ large time jumps, as
well as \NShotsTimeFlashback\ flashbacks.

Table \ref{tab:stats} provides information on the portrayal of unique locations
in the movie.
